# In this repository we had taken the species_complete document and picked two variables (weight and hindfoot length) and
plotted the two in relation to species identity in two seperate graphs. We sought to find a coorelation between average weights
and average hindfoot lengths of each species, and found that there was a slight relationship. However, with missing data 
in both variables the data cannot be viewed as conclusive.
